# Idiomatic Prompt Generator

This project transforms plain human-written text into idiomatic expressions, with the goal of generating diverse and natural-sounding prompts. These prompts can be used to fine-tune language models for more nuanced and expressive output.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔁 Converts plain language into idioms and figurative speech
- 🧠 Useful for generating diverse and high-quality training data
- 📦 Ready to integrate with fine-tuning pipelines (e.g., for LLMs)
- 💡 Enhances creativity and expressiveness in model output

## 🚀 Use Case

When building a language model and want it to understand or generate idiomatic, non-literal language. This tool helps by transforming straightforward prompts like:

"I’m very happy today."

into:


"I'm on cloud nine today."


These transformed prompts can then be used in datasets for **fine-tuning** or **data augmentation**.
